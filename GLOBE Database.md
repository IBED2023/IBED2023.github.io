# **GLOBE**

Global Building Emissions (GLOBE) Database 

A multi-regional dataset aims to monitor energy trends, emissions mitigation, and building stock on a global scale.

GLOBE was initially proposed by [Dr. Minda Ma](https://buildings.lbl.gov/people/minda-ma) in 2021, and now it is a project led by [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory<img src='./image/logo-LBNL.png' style='width: 4em;'>](https://buildings.lbl.gov/)(LBNL, operated by UC Berkeley for U.S. DOE), [Tsinghua University<img src='./image/logo-THQ.png' style='width: 4em;'>](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), and [Chongqing University<img src='./image/logo_CQU.png' style='width: 4em;'>](https://www.cqu.edu.cn).

## About GLOBE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

We are pleased to announce the release of a public version of our dataset, which is accessible at [http://ibed.world](http://ibed.world/). Our dataset is established based on the IEA database, which has clear distinctions between the end uses relevant to residential and commercial energy activities in its energy balance sheet.

To ensure the reliability of our database, we used the [IEA dataset](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics) as the primary reference to compile comprehensive and trustworthy data tables for each carbon-emitting country. For major emitters such as [China](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111915), [the United States](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542435119303575), and [India](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.01.065), we accounted for and calibrated the building energy consumption data and the corresponding carbon emissions data based on the baseline dataset. For other carbon-emitting countries, we collected, cleaned, and validated survey reports and statistical results from regional governments and research institutions, which were then integrated with the baseline dataset to build a unified and standardized database.

## Data availability

For additional information, including **detailed energy activities of residential buildings' end uses, commercial building stocks, and energy and emissions of commercial buildings' end uses**, you can contact the project leader, [Dr. Minda Ma](https://buildings.lbl.gov/people/minda-ma), at <maminda@lbl.gov>. We will provide the requested information upon reasonable request.



## ArchTracking

ArchTracking is an upcoming software program for tracking the nation-regional energy and emission impacts of building decarbonization measures.



## PyLMDI

**Python-LMDI: a tool for index decomposition analysis of building carbon emissions**

A timely analysis for carbon emission reduction in buildings is an effective global response to the crisis of climate change. The logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition analysis approach has been extensively used to assess the carbon emission reduction potential of the buildings sector. In order to simplify the calculation process and to expand its application scope, a new open-source Python tool (PyLMDI) developed in this article is used to compute the results of LMDI decomposition analysis, including multiplicative and additive decomposition. Users can quickly obtain the decomposition result by initializing the input data through a simple class data structure. In addition, the carbon emissions from commercial buildings are used as a numerical example to demonstrate the function of PyLMDI. In summary, PyLMDI is a potential calculation tool for index decomposition analysis that can provide calculation guidance for carbon emission reduction in the buildings sector. The data and codes for the numerical example are also included.

## GLOBUS

In 2024, we create a global building stock model (GLOBUS) incorporating turnover and renovations.

GLOBUS’s primary contribution lies in providing a dataset of global building stock turnover using scenarios that incorporate various levels of building renovation. 

By unifying the evaluation indicators, the dataset empowers building science researchers to perform comparative analyses based on floorspace.
